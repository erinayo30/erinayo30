            When it was established in March 1982, It was named Obafemi Awolowo University, by the government of the Old Ondo State,
        led by the late Chief Adekunle Ajasin. The suceedring mliltary government of Navy Commodore Bamidele Otiko changed the name to Ondo State 
    University in 1985 </p>
